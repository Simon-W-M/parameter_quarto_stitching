# Quarto framework

This is a methodology for collaborate approach for reporting.

The plan is for seperate quarto reports being created as child reports and then being pulled into a parent report.

Child reports and be dynamically selected or included or not, depending on requirements.

The report also feeds parameters and so a number of reports can be prodduced but with different features in each report.
