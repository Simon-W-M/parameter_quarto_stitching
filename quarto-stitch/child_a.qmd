## Child report A

Just checking below that the same parameter is pulled through

```{r}
params$cyl
```

The data for this table is sourced from another R script.

This means we can have separate scripts to the reporting process.

We could also create separate r script for functions,  if well documented, we could reuse plots and table across the report, to maintain a consistent look and feel.

```{r}
#| echo: false
 data_sw |>
   dplyr::select(1:5) |>
   head() |>
   gt()

```
